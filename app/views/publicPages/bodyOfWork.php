                        karmaCRM is a SaaS based business that offers Customer Relationship Management solutions to small and medium sized businesses.
                        I was initially contracted to karmaCRM to provide SEO services.
                        However after learning more about their business model and spotting some under-performing processes, I worked with them to accomplish much more.
                        Eventually working my way up to the role of Director of Growth.

                        This was initially a consulting project that transformed into a full blown software development contract.
                        The owner looked to solve the niche problems that new web based entrepreneurs experience.
                        These markets include Developers who don't know how to market, marketers who don't anything about code,
                        and stakeholders who know neither.
                        Working with the owner we came up with solutions that included innovative learning solutions like;
                        Facilitating one on one training, unique courses that allowed interaction with the course provider,
                        and vetted resources from industry leaders.

                    The project has since completed and is now a full alpha-ready SaaS product.
                    The owner asked me to stay on as a co-founder to which I had to decline due to time conflicts.

                    Try to give it a minute to load as the owner is looking to keep cost down allocating very little dynos via Heroku hosting platform.

                        A few years ago when starting the blog the owner reached out to me for help in marketing her content.
                        She is one of the most efficient and engaged business professionals I have worked with and wanted to learn how to maintain an SEO presence on her own.
                        So she contracted me to help her learn SEO.

                        A collaborator of mine who owned a software and web design company had a client who needed marketing help.
                        The client ended up being NomadYogi, an innovative SaaS startup providing solutions to the yoga instructor and enthusiast markets.
                        The owner of NomadYogi was spending a ton of capital in marketing monthly, with little to no return.
                        Reaching out to me I developed a strategy that included terminating the current marketing vendor, and following simple approaches that if done correctly could
                        reduce the marketing budget, convert more visitors, and maintain current traffic volume.

                        Carol Delzer, the owner of the Family Law Center, is a very impressive attorney, multiple author, and industry expert on collaborative co-parenting.
                        However Carol did not have the time to manage the marketing of the Family Law Center and generate enough leads to her other attorneys.
                        Carol originally contracted another marketing consultant whom she terminated before bringing me on in a light role to optimize & manage her Google Adwords account.

                    Working with Carol was a great experience. I got to see the results of bad marketing not just on a business but the business owner.
                    I saw how distrusting she was of marketing people even though she knew she needed one.
                    Unfortunately the contract eventually ended and I began focusing on karmaCRM full time.

                        In 2013, I started working with The Sacramento Employment lawyers in one of my first freelance roles.
                        Up to this point I was primarily a W-2 employee. I was immediately hit with both the benefits and a few negatives of freelancing.
                        The benefits included freedom, full autonomy of my schedule, and the ability to be selective about projects.
                        The evils are Elance fees and self-employment taxes. They are the worst!

                    The Sacramento Employment Lawyers was a Sacramento based law firm specializing in employment law (smile).
                    I helped them convert more of their traffic, optimize the design of their website, and wrote engaging content for their audiences.
                    Here is <a href="http://www.thesacramentoemploymentlawyers.com/">their website</a> if your interested.
